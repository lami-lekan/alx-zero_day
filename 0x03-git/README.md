Git and Github

Git is a free and opem source distribute version control system designed to handle everything from small to large projects with speed and efficiency.

Version control is a system that records change to a file or set of files over time so that one can recall a particular version later.

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It adds collaboration features on top of Git, making it easier for multiple people to work together on projects.
