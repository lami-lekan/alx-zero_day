Just like in movies, a script tells the actors what to do or say, likewise a bash script tells the bash shell what
it should do per time.

A Bash script is a plain text file which contains a series of commands. These commands are commands we use on the
command line - echo, ls, cd.

Bash script files do end with the .sh extention, although it doesn't have to have an extention to work, because Linux is an extentionless system.

The Shebang(#!)

#!/bin/bash

helps the computer to know that the file is a bash script and also the path to the interpreter that can run it.
